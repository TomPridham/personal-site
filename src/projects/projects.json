    "extended_description": "I sometimes have trouble picking what task I should work on next. I have a lot of tasks that are all relatively equal priority, but I have a lot of more tasks related to house projects. So I can't just use a normal random number generator unless I want to spend 90% of my time doing house tasks. This will parse an arbitrarily deep nested list where each <TAB> denotes a nesting level and traverse down the list, selecting a random task at each step until it reaches the bottom",

The images are all hand drawn by me if you couldn't tell. It compiles to WASM and works on my website because it makes sharing it a lot easier and I thought it was neat.",

    "extended_description": "An old boss of mine found a site that had a person's project called brutemoji that did what my library does but in JS. I really liked their project and used it to create a few fun images. I haven't been able to find that same site again, so I thought I would recreate it in rust. I like the final product better than other more intelligent emoji image replicators because the final image is much more chaotic and ultimately more interesting.",
