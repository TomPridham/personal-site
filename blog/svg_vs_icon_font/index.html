const colorMap = {
  blue: 'filter: invert(39%) sepia(88%) saturate(1890%) hue-rotate(165deg) brightness(101%) contrast(101%)'
  }
const Icon = ({name, height, color}) =&gt;
  &lt;img src={`https://myHostingService.com/${name}`} style={{height, filter: colorMap[color]}}/&gt;
</code></pre><p>this method allows for the pros of having your svgs be cached by the browser and allowing for adding arbitrary svg icons just by adding the svg file to the hosting location. it has the rather significant downside of requiring the images to be styled using the `filter` css attribute above. there are formulas(see https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) that can convert a hex value to the filter, but some colors just don't work. it also requires interacting with the svgs like images instead of as native `svg` elements. we rejected this method for those reasons.</p><p>the other method is inlining the svgs. initially this seems like it might be a good method, but it's shortcomings become apparent very quickly. inlining the svgs allows you to interact with them as HTML elements, which makes styling them a much nicer experience. but this method doesn't allow for caching by the browser which means that the icons will need to be fetched anew on every page load. it also results in a much heavier page because of the size of an svg is going to be larger byte-wise than an `img` tag with the src set. this only gets worse as you include more svg icons on your page. it also brings back the original problem of having to make code changes to add any new icons. it can also make bundle splitting out unused icons problematic if not done correctly. the below svg is about 5x larger than the equivalent `img` tag above and will need to be readded to the dom every time it is used</p><code>

                </code><p>we came up with a third method that is a little more complicated, but that brings all the benefits of both approaches with none of the downsides. you can fetch the svgs as images and then insert them into the DOM using `innerHtml` and then reference them with `use` tags. this allows for caching the responses, styling the svgs using normal svg selectors, only fetching required icons once.</p><pre><code>
const Icon = ({name}) =&gt; {
  if (!document.querySelector(`#${name}`)) {
    window.fetch(`https://myHostingService/${name}.svg`)
      .then(res =&gt; {
        if (res.ok) {
          res.text().then(svg =&gt; {
            const el = document.createElement('div')
            el.innerHTML = svg
            el.firstChild.id = icon
            document.querySelector('#icon-container').appendChild(el)
          })
        }
      })
    }
  }
  return &lt;svg&gt;&lt;use href={`#${name}`} /&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
