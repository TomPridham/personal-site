I switched to cs, took some classes, and realized it would have been another three years before I could graduate. I ended up getting an associates in math because I had enough credits and didn't want to waste any more time at university.</p><p>After I got my associates, I attended DevMountain(a web dev bootcamp in Provo, UT) where I primarily learned AngularJS. I then freelanced for a couple months, mentored a class at DevMountain(teaching react), mentored an after hours class at DevMountain. I got my first software development job at Sundance and haven't looked back.</p><p>Currently, I live in Millcreek with my wife and three dogs. I spend most of my time playing around with rust, doing yardwork, playing video games, or woodworking. I enjoy mountain biking, snowboarding, and indoor climbing.</p></div><script type="text/javascript">
